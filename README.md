############# GAME CONTROLS

ALTERNATE MOVEMENT: The ARROW keys can also be used as movement keys. 

GAME CONTROL: The player will mainly use the E key in order to interact with different objects within the game. The player will also use the TAB key in order to access their inventory. The G key can be used to drop the currently equipped item. 

MENU CONTROL: The player may pause the game at any time and navigate back to the main menu using the ESCAPE key. 

############# GAME OBJECTIVE 

The character has just been involved in a helicopter crash on an island she was meant to destroy. Nobody else has survived the crash and she must make her way through the several islands that make up this compound in order to find a way to communicate with someone that can help her. The government wants to deny the knowledge of this operation, so she knows nobody is coming to look for her. 
The player must explore the island and will find different clues leading them to a next challenge. This demo island (LEVEL 1) is not deadly, so demo players are encouraged to mess around with the different features currently in our game and give constructive feedback on gameplay. 

############# SCOPE OF THE GAME (STORY)

A single Apache helicopter has been dispatched to destroy classified targets on islands that technically do not exist. The two pilots, which one of them we control, have no idea what they are meant to be destroying, but they are told that there must be no human survivors. The United States government has decided to completely sweep the program and remove any possible liabilities to avoid an international conflict.

When they approached their first target, one of three islands, the pilots have no idea what hit them. The attack was completely undetectable by the instruments on board. The crash leaves one pilot dead and the other severely disoriented and with no idea what she is up against. She will soon discover that the human life across these three environments has already been eliminated and that finding a way out of here will be harder than she thinks considering the government has no intentions of coming to look for her.

She remembers during her briefing that one of the key targets was a helipad located next to a radio tower that could potentially allow her to communicate with the outside world. When the player takes control, they have no idea what they are up against nor how to make their way to the radio tower. They will need to roam the edges of islands looking for clues and will soon realize that they are not alone and will have to fight their way through the two facilities.

My worst fears have come true; all the tests have failed, except one. All of the artificial intelligence programs have come up dry for the small arms program, the robots have been unstimulated by any of the tests in all environments. Only one has responded, but it seems she has gone much further into her deep learning cycle than we anticipated.

It seems that Vanessa, the system which was supposed to serve as a state-of-the-art data analyst for your compatriots in the National Security Agency has gone rogue. We are unable to bring her back within our control scope. Vanessa has been able to pass on knowledge to the other systems in our facilities and, since then, their successful activities have gone way beyond our range of simple tests. I fear that the systems may soon be able to use themselves against us. Their knowledge has been growing exponentially and we are losing more control as hours pass.

I am demanding a shut down of this program immediately. Please, listen to my warning, these beings have been constructed to be the ultimate war machines and I do not believe anything will be able to stop them if they reach their full potential – and more. We must act NOW.
