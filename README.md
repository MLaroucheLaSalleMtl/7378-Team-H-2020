GAME OBJECTIVE 
The character has just been involved in a helicopter crash on an island she was meant to destroy. Nobody else has survived the crash and she must make her way through the several islands that make up this compound in order to find a way to communicate with someone that can help her. The government wants to deny the knowledge of this operation, so she knows nobody is coming to look for her. 
The player must explore the island and will find different clues leading them to a next challenge. This demo island (LEVEL 1) is not deadly, so demo players are encouraged to mess around with the different features currently in our game and give constructive feedback on gameplay.
